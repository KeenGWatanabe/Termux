The error message `No superuser binary detected. Are you rooted?` suggests that the `sudo` command is not functioning correctly or the system is not recognizing your root privileges properly. Here's how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### 1. **Check if You Are Root**
Run the following command to confirm if you are logged in as the root user:
```bash
whoami
```
If the output is `root`, you are already the root user and don't need to use `sudo`. Simply run:
```bash
nano config.yaml
```

---

### 2. **Verify `sudo` Installation**
If you are not root and need to use `sudo`, check if `sudo` is installed:
```bash
which sudo
```
If `sudo` is not installed, install it:
```bash
apt update
apt install sudo
```

---

### 3. **Check `sudo` Configuration**
If `sudo` is installed but not working, check if your user is added to the `sudoers` file:
```bash
sudo -l
```
If you get an error, add your user to the `sudo` group:
```bash
usermod -aG sudo your_username
```
Then log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

---

### 4. **Edit the File as Root**
If you are already root, you don't need `sudo`. Just open the file directly with `nano`:
```bash
nano /root/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

---

### 5. **Check for Restricted Shell**
If you're in a restricted environment (e.g., a container or chroot jail), some commands like `sudo` might not be available. In this case:
- Confirm if you are in a restricted shell:
  ```bash
echo $SHELL
```
- If you are, try to escalate privileges using `su` (if available):
```bash
su -
```

---

### 6. **Alternative Editors**
If `nano` is not working, try using another editor like `vim` or `vi`:
```bash
vim /root/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```
Or, if you have a GUI, use `gedit` or `code` (VS Code):
```bash
gedit /root/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

---

### 7. **Check for System Issues**
If none of the above works, there might be a system issue. Reboot the system and try again:
```bash
reboot
```
