If you're running `code-server` and it's asking for a password, but you can't open another terminal to check or configure it, don't worry! Here's how you can resolve the issue:

---

### **1. Find the Default Password**
When you first run `code-server`, it generates a default password and saves it in a configuration file. You can retrieve it by following these steps:

1. **Locate the config file:**
   The configuration file is usually located at `~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`.

   2. **View the file:**
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
cat ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

3. **Find the password:**
Look for a line like this:
```
password: <your-password>
```
This is the password you need to enter when accessing `localhost:8080`.

---

### **2. Set a New Password**
If you want to set a new password, you can do so by editing the configuration file:

1. **Open the config file:**
Use a text editor like `nano`:
```bash
nano ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

2. **Change the password:**
Find the `password` line and replace the existing password with your desired password:
```
password: <your-new-password>
    ```

3. **Save and exit:**
- In `nano`, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter` to save and exit.

4. **Restart `code-server`:**
Stop and restart `code-server` for the changes to take effect:
```bash
pkill code-server
code-server
```

---

### **3. Run `code-server` Without a Password**
If you want to disable the password requirement entirely, you can run `code-server` with the `--auth none` flag:

1. **Stop `code-server` if it's running:**
    ```bash
        pkill code-server
                                                                                 ```

                                                                                 2. **Start `code-server` without authentication:**
                                                                                ```bash
                                                                                    code-server --auth none
                                                                                        ```

                                                                                3. **Access `code-server`:**
                                                                                    Now, you should be able to access `localhost:8080` without being prompted for a password.

                                                                                             ---

                                                                                ### **4. Use a Different Port (Optional)**
                                                                                If port `8080` is already in use or you want to use a different port, you can specify a custom port when starting `code-server`:

                                                                                ```bash
                                                                                code-server --port 8081
                                                                                ```
                                                                                Then, access it at `localhost:8081`.

                                                                                ---

                                                                                ### **5. Accessing the Terminal in Android**
                                                                                If you're unable to open another terminal on your Android device, you can use the following workarounds:

                                                                                - **Use Termux Widgets:**
                                                                                Install the Termux:Widget app to create shortcuts for running commands without opening the full Termux app.

                                                                                - **Use SSH:**
                                                                                    Set up an SSH server in your `proot-ubuntu` environment and connect to it from another device (e.g., a PC or another Android device) using an SSH client.

                                                                                - **Use a Multiplexer:**
                                                                                Use a terminal multiplexer like `tmux` or `screen` to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single terminal window.

                                                                                                   ---

                                                                                ### **6. Restarting `code-server`**
                                                                                If you need to restart `code-server` but can't open another terminal, you can kill the existing process and restart it in the same terminal:

                                                                                1. **Kill the existing process:**
                                                                                ```bash
                                                                                pkill code-server
                                                                                ```

                                                                                2. **Start `code-server` again:**
                                                                                ```bash
                                                                                    code-server
                                                                                                    ```

                                                                                                    ---

                                                                                Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further assistance!
